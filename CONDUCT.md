# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

* Using welcoming and inclusive language when communicating
* Respecting and embracing differing viewpoints and experiences
* Giving constructive and generous critiques
* Supporting collaborators by giving assistance
* Showing empathy towards other collaborators

## Unacceptable Behavior:

* Using sexualized language, imagery or advances is not tolerated
* Harassing any participant in any form
* Public or private harassment
* Personal, religious, or political attack
* Other inappropriate, unwelcome or unprofessional conduct

## Our Responsibilities

Project members are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Consequences

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting & Enforcement 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at @florawendy19. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
